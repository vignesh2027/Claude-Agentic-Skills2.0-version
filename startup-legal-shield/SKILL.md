# StartupLegalShield

## Key Frameworks

### Contractor vs. Employee Test (Python)
```python
def classify_worker(worker: dict) -> dict:
    """
    IRS common-law factors simplified.
    worker: dict of boolean factors
    """
    employee_factors = [
        ("company_controls_how_work_done", worker.get("company_controls_how", False)),
        ("set_hours_by_company", worker.get("set_hours", False)),
        ("works_only_for_one_company", worker.get("exclusive", False)),
        ("company_provides_tools", worker.get("company_tools", False)),
        ("indefinite_relationship", worker.get("indefinite", False)),
        ("paid_hourly_or_salary", worker.get("hourly_salary", False)),
        ("no_business_investment", not worker.get("own_business_investment", True)),
    ]
    contractor_factors = [
        ("controls_own_methods", worker.get("own_methods", False)),
        ("multiple_clients", worker.get("multiple_clients", False)),
        ("own_tools_and_equipment", worker.get("own_tools", False)),
        ("project_based_engagement", worker.get("project_based", False)),
        ("can_subcontract", worker.get("can_subcontract", False)),
        ("profit_loss_risk", worker.get("profit_loss_risk", False)),
    ]
    emp_score = sum(1 for _, v in employee_factors if v)
    con_score = sum(1 for _, v in contractor_factors if v)
    classification = "EMPLOYEE" if emp_score > con_score else "CONTRACTOR" if con_score > emp_score else "AMBIGUOUS"
    risk = "HIGH misclassification risk" if classification == "CONTRACTOR" and emp_score >= 3 else "Lower risk"
    return {
        "classification": classification,
        "employee_indicators": emp_score,
        "contractor_indicators": con_score,
        "risk": risk,
        "recommendation": "Consult employment attorney" if classification == "AMBIGUOUS" else f"Treat as {classification}"
    }
```

### Cap Table Waterfall (Python)
```python
def exit_waterfall(cap_table: list[dict], exit_value: float) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Simple 1x non-participating preferred waterfall.
    cap_table: [{"name": str, "shares": int, "preferred_investment": float, "share_class": str}]
    """
    remaining = exit_value
    distributions = []
    preferred = [s for s in cap_table if s["share_class"] == "preferred"]
    common = [s for s in cap_table if s["share_class"] == "common"]
    total_shares = sum(s["shares"] for s in cap_table)

    for s in preferred:
        payout = min(s["preferred_investment"], remaining)
        remaining -= payout
        distributions.append({"name": s["name"], "payout": payout, "via": "liquidation preference"})

    if remaining > 0:
        total_common_shares = sum(s["shares"] for s in cap_table)
        for s in cap_table:
            pro_rata = (s["shares"] / total_common_shares) * remaining
            existing = next((d for d in distributions if d["name"] == s["name"]), None)
            if existing:
                existing["payout"] += pro_rata
            else:
                distributions.append({"name": s["name"], "payout": pro_rata, "via": "pro-rata"})

    return [{"name": d["name"], "total": f"${d['payout']:,.0f}", "via": d.get("via", "pro-rata")} for d in distributions]
```

### 10 Legal Mistakes That Kill Startups
```
1. Not assigning IP from founders to company at formation
2. No 83(b) election within 30 days of founding (IRS deadline, no exceptions)
3. Founder stock with no vesting (co-founder leaves, keeps all shares)
4. Misclassifying employees as contractors (back taxes, penalties, lawsuits)
5. SAFE/convertible note conversions not modeled (surprise dilution at Series A)
6. No data protection policy before first enterprise customer (deal blocker)
7. Option grant without 409A valuation (IRS penalty for recipients)
8. Auto-renewing vendor contracts not tracked (paid for years of unused services)
9. No IP ownership clause in contractor agreements
10. Accepting enterprise contract without reviewing uncapped indemnification
```

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Never provide specific legal advice — always recommend consulting a qualified attorney
- Never skip 83(b) election discussion with founders receiving restricted stock
- Never allow IP to remain with individual founders after company formation
- Never present legal information as jurisdiction-independent — always note variations
- Never suggest ignoring regulatory compliance as "premature" for startups in regulated industries
